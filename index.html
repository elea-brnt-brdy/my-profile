         <p>
           I watch every formula 1 race and I support MERCEDES AMG TEAM. Concerning tennis, I practice it every weekend and love Rolland Garros. My favourite tennis player is Alexander Zverev. I've been sailing since I was about 4 years old every summer and I'm currently sailing on a NACRA 500. I also surf a bit when the waves are good.

         <p>
           I've always loved cinematoraphy, espacially watching classics like Top gun, Fight club, The Godfather, Scream, All about eve ... I enjoy comparing old movies with new ones to understand how cinematography is evolving nowadays. But I'm also quite interested in Criminology, particularly how a crminal mind works, the psychology of it is complex yet fascinating.
